# Delivery proof: source grounding and live observations

Part of the [native delivery proof](../delivery-proof.md). Previous page is [Delivery proof: contract and boundary](contract.md). Next page is [Guide distribution decision after live proof](guide-distribution.md).

The inspected npm-installed Copilot package was `1.0.83` (`e6a98f1`), with bundled
SDK source labelled `1.0.13-preview.4`. Package-relative references:

- `copilot-sdk/docs/extensions.md`: project discovery, CLI-owned child lifecycle,
  and joining the current conversation (not desktop foreground focus).
- `copilot-sdk/extension.js:11365–11390`: parent-process join via `SESSION_ID`.
- `copilot-sdk/extension.js:7533–7547`: native `session.send` RPC.
- `copilot-sdk/types.d.ts:2712–2717`: native `enqueue` delivery mode.
- `copilot-sdk/docs/examples.md:194–208`: fire-and-forget new-user-message example.

Inspected `extension.js` SHA-256:
`7c6498e44e5e6d7718bdfb14ffa3b03b0eb07f51e2fc178c9a1771a6482b945d`.
These are declarations/source evidence, not a guarantee about composer behavior.
The parent reported installed CMUX `0.64.25 (106) [b685a275c]`; this worker did not
query its runtime. The live Copilot UI reported `1.0.87-0`, distinct from the
inspected npm source version above.

In a separate background workspace, real peers launched through the pinned
launcher exchanged native messages after human approvals: B received A's
`cedar-54-1` challenge and called send; A received B's native `user.message`
body `violet-54-1` and rendered final answer `violet-54-1`. B's earlier initial
turn returned “No response was returned”. It did not prevent the later exchange.
External MCP startup warnings were also present. That exchange alone did not
verify draft preservation or every
[bounded live check](live-checks.md).

## L3 live draft-preservation observation

The human placed `HUMAN-DRAFT-54` unsent in B. The parent then injected one native
test message through the disposable A capability route to B, using private
same-user fixture bindings. B received the native `user.message`. This was
**parent-controlled, harness-origin injection, not a message authored by A**,
unlike the first real A → B → A agent-tool exchange above. No terminal-input or
focus operation was used.

The human explicitly confirmed **“Preserved exactly and still editable”**, then
“yeah it worked” and “brilliant”. This confirmation, not screenshots, is the
evidence for preservation and continued editability of the unsent draft.
This draft result alone does not establish app-background or sidebar-hidden
delivery. The separate app-background observation follows.

## L3 app-background delivery observation

The user explicitly said they were putting the app in the background. The parent
injected one native harness message through the disposable B route to fresh A,
with body `Parent harness app-background check: background-54-1`. A's native
final response contained that exact body at `2026-09-21T22:03:01.267Z`.
This was parent-controlled harness injection using the disposable route, not
a message authored by B.

Read-only `NSWorkspace` observations showed CMUX was **not foreground immediately
before or after** the check; different non-CMUX applications were foreground
at those two observations. Their names are intentionally omitted. The harness
performed no focus, window, or workspace operations.

**App-background delivery was observed**, supported by the user's stated action,
the before/after foreground observations, and the native response. These are
point-in-time observations, not continuous foreground-state monitoring.
**Sidebar-hidden remains unconfirmed**. This check does not establish it.

## L4 fresh YOLO-launch observation

The parent reported a successful autonomous exchange using fresh fixture
`live54b` in a new background workspace. Both new sessions launched with
`--delivery-proof-yolo` and `--delivery-proof-experimental`. B received challenge
`cedar-54-2`. A's native session rendered final answer `violet-54-2` at
`2026-09-21T21:58:20.459Z`. The parent harness performed no approval clicks,
terminal input, or resends. These were fresh sessions, not reuse of the first
pair whose permissions had been changed by human interaction.

**Fresh explicit YOLO-launch verification is demonstrated.** This establishes
the per-spawn opt-in, not full parent-permission inheritance. A background
workspace does not establish the application's foreground/background state or
the sidebar-hidden condition. The separate L3 check above supplies app-background
evidence. Sidebar-hidden remains unconfirmed.

The [discovery foundation](../agent/discovery/issue-38-shared-agent-interaction.md)
preserves the Orca, Paseo, Herdr, and CMUX revision-pinned comparisons and their
source-versus-runtime distinctions. This proof does not redo that research.
